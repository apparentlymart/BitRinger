bitringer
---------

bitringer is a monochrome 2d graphics library designed to make it easy to
drive byte-per-eight-pixel displays, such as LED matrixes driven by
MAX7219 matrix driver chips or Sharp Memory LCDs.

It consists of a base class BitCanvas that implements drawing commands against
an in-memory bitmap, and then a few different subclasses that propagate
bitmap updates to a real display.

To allow easy testing on a general purpose computer there is also a special
subclass that displays the image onscreen using SDL.

Since this library represents 8 pixels with each byte there are natually
some special operations that work on 8-pixel alignment. The 8 bits in a byte
proceed on the x axis from least-significant to most-significant. The name
"xbyte" is used to refer to a variable that refers to an aligned 8-pixel
portion of the bitmap starting at xbyte * 8 pixels.
